Keys are put in bold online (and quotes in gedit file).

UNF: This is all the data grouped together.

Group(PersonnelNo, Name, Date_of_birth, LabCode, LabName, ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

1NF: Remove repeating groups -> research code, description and supervisor

Personnel("PersonnelNo", Name, Date_of_Birth, Labcode, LabName), Research("PersonnelNo", "ResearchCode", ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

2NF: all non-primary attributes must be dependent on the whole key. ResearchDescription and ResearchSupervisor are only dependent on ResearchCode, so this must be split off.

Personnel("PersonnelNo", Name, Date_of_Birth, Labcode, LabName), Crossref("PersonnelNo", "ResearchCode") Research ("ResearchCode", ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

3NF: all non-primary attributes must be non-transitively dependent on the key. Labname is dependent on LabCode which is dependent on PersonnelNo. This is transitively dependent, so it must be split off.

Personnel("PersonnelNo", Name, Date_of_Birth, Labcode), Lab("LabCode", LabName), Crossref("PersonnelNo", "ResearchCode") Research ("ResearchCode", ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)
